The solution involves adjusting the custom build script to avoid modifying files Expo relies on during the prebuild stage.  This might entail:

1. **Moving the modifications:**  Perform your custom build steps *after* `expo prebuild` completes.  Expo's build process should be allowed to finish before any modifications are made.
2. **Conditional logic:** Add conditional logic to your custom script, ensuring that specific files targeted for modification by the script are only processed if not already handled by the Expo prebuild process. 
3. **File exclusions:**  Exclude any files that your custom script modifies from the scope of the script's operation if those files are needed by expo prebuild. 

Here's an example of how to adjust the build process to avoid conflict (this would replace the incorrect `bug.js`):

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
expo.prebuildAsync().then(()=>{
  //Your custom build script here, this will execute after expo prebuild
})
```
